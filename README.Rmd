This package offers an interface for objective functions in the context of (multi-objective) global optimization. It conveniently builds up on the S3 objects, i. e., an objective function is a S3 object composed of a descriptive name, the function itself, a parameter set, box constraints or other constraints, number of objectives and so on. Moreover, the package contains generators for a load of both single- and multi-objective optimization test functions which are frequently being used in the literature of (benchmarking) optimization algorithms.
The bi-objective ZDT function family by Zitzler, Deb and Thiele is included as well as the popular single-objective test functions like De Jong's function, Himmelblau function and Schwefel function. Moreover, the package offers a R interface to the C implementation of the *Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking* (BBOB) [set of noiseless test functions](http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php?id=bbob-2009-downloads).

At the moment the following optimization test functions respectively function sets/families are implemented:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis", message = FALSE}
library(devtools)
library(BBmisc)
library(knitr)

load_all(".")

generators = getGeneratorFunctions()
fun.names = sapply(generators, function(x) attr(x, "name"))
names(fun.names) = NULL
fun.names = data.frame("Function" = fun.names)
kable(fun.names, format = "markdown")
```

## Installation instructions

Visit the [package repository on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/smoof/index.html). If you want to take a glance at the developement version install the github developement version by executing the following command:

```splus
devtools::install_github("jakobbossek/smoof")
```

## Example

### Use a build-in generator
Assume the simplifying case where we want to benchmark a set of optimization algorithms on a single objective instance. We decide outself for the popular 10-dimensional Rosenbrock banana function. Instead of looking up the function defintion, the box constraints and where the global optimum is located, we simply generate the function with **smoof** and get all the stuff:

```splus
library(ggplot2)
library(plot3D)

obj.fn = makeRosenbrockFunction(dimensions = 2L)
print(obj.fn)
print(autoplot(obj.fn))
plot3D(obj.fn, length.out = 50L, contour = TRUE)
```

### Set up an objective function by hand
Let us consider the problem of finding the (global) minimum of the multimodal target function f(x) = x sin(3x) on the closed intervall [0, 2PI]. We define our target function via the ```makeSingleObjectiveFunction()``` method providing a name, the function itself and a parameter set. We can display the function within the box constraints with ggplot.

```splus
library(ggplot2)

obj.fn = makeSingleObjectiveFunction(
  name = "My fancy function name",
  fn = function(x) x * sin(3*x),
  par.set = makeNumericParamSet("x", len = 1L, lower = 0, upper = 2*pi))
)
print(obj.fn)
print(getParamSet(obj.fn))
print(autoplot(obj.fn))
```

The [ecr](https://github.com/jakobbossek/ecr) package for evolutionary computing in R needs builds upon smoof functions.
