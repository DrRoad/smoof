smoof v1.1.9000 (Release data: xxxx-xx-xx)
============

* Renamed makeFunctionByName to makeFunctionsByName
* Added tags 'single-objective' and 'multi-objective'
* filterFunctionByTags now stops if both 'single-objective' and 'multi-objective'
  tags are passed
* All functions now check the passed paramter to be of the right dimension and
  type
* makeFunctionsByName now expects a character vector generator names (the list
  methods was removed)
* Generator names now do not contain the 'Function' suffix

smoof v1.1 (Release date: 2015-11-24):
============

* Parameter set of predefined smoof function now contains a single vector parameter
  instead of multiple single numeric parameters. This is consistent with function
  calls now, since these always expect a single vector or list.
* Added helper function get{Lower,Upper}BoxConstraints
* smoof functions now expect an optional 'minimize' argument which indicates which
  objectives should be minimized or maximized respectively
* Fixed some wrong tag assigments
* Added shouldBeMinimized function
* Fixed global optimum of Giunta function
* Added function makeFunctionByName, which expects a function name or a list of
  functions names. The corresponding generator(s) is/are  called. Useful if you want,
  e.g., filter functions by tags and generate them directly afterwards.
* Added hasTags helper function.
* filterFunctionByTags now has an additional logical argument 'or'. If this is set
  to TRUE, a subset of the passed tags is sufficient to select a function.
* Added multi-objective DTLZ function family
* Added 2D single objective functions: Aluffi-Pentini-(Zirilli), Complex, Engvall,
  Jennrich-Sampsam, Judge, Kearfott
* Renamed bochachevsky function to bohachevsky.n1

smoof v1.0 (Release date: 2015-05-19):
==========

* First submission to CRAN.
